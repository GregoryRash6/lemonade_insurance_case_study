# Lemonade Insurance Case Study

<!-- Overview -->
## Overview and Origin

<!-- Name of Company -->
* Lemonade, Inc.

<!-- When was the company incorporated? -->
* Lemonade was incorporated in April of 2015 in New York City.

<!-- Who are the founders of this company? -->
* Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger founded Lemonade and now serve as the CEO and President & COO, respectively.

<!-- How did the idea for the company come about? -->
* The idea for the company came about when the founders were tired of the traditional insurance model. They have stated that it lacked technology and transparency. Lemonade's business model is different from traditional insurance models because they take a flat fee, so they are motivated to handle claims quickly. 

<!-- How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? -->
* Lemonade has been funded by a series of investors, including Aleph, Sequoia Capital Israel, Allianz, and Softbank. In total, they have received $480 million in funding. 


<!-- Busines Activities -->
## Busines Activities

<!-- What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve? -->
* Lemonade is attempting to solve the "claims" model of dealing with insurance companies. Traditionally, when a claim is paid out, the insurance company loses money. This is why it can be challenging to be paid in full. By reconstructing the insurance model, the hassle we currently face will be solved.

<!-- Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) -->
* Lemonade currently offers homeowners, renters, condo, and pet health insurance. Their insurance availability varies by type. Their homeowners insurance is available in 23 states and Washington D.C., renters insurance is available in 27 states and Washington D.C., condo insurance is available in 26 states, and pet health insurance in 33 states and Washington D.C. The market size is in the millions and steadily growing, as they are expanding their insurance products in additional states in the coming year. Their utilization of technology gives them a competitive edge over their competitors. The ability to file claims quickly and utilize a smart phone app is crucial. They make the user experience familar to their everyday life. This key difference plus their different business model makes them in line for a huge disruption in insurance. 

<!-- Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? -->
* Lemonade is looking for people with these skills, a key sign that they may be using this technology. On the front end, they need JavaScript (Angular or React) and CSS. They stated that they only use Macs and are obsessed with React. For a data science position I saw available, they were looking for skills with Python or R and to be knowleedgable of both SQL and NoSQL databases. Additionally, they have a Cloud security Engineer role where AWS, Docker, Terraform, and more are needed. Staying at the cutting edge of technology is important for Lemonade to stay competitive. Handling technology needs in house and implementing them how your consumers want it, like on an app, keeps the growth and success steady. 


<!-- Landscape -->
## Landscape

<!-- What domain of the financial industry is the company in? -->
* Lemonade is in the InsurTech domain of the financial industry. 

<!-- What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? -->
* A major trend that the insurance industry has seen over the last 5-10 years is the implementation of technology. Technology can solve many problems like creating more advanced claims models for the traditional insurance companies or give the potential to create new insurance models, as Lemonade has. 

<!-- What are the other major companies in this domain? -->
* ZhongAn, Slice, Oscar Health, and Acko General Insurance are some of Lemonade's biggest competitors in the InsurTech space. 

<!-- Results -->
## Results


<!-- What has been the business impact of this company so far? -->
* Lemonade's revenue in 2019 was $67.3 million, however, their net loss in the same year was $108.5 million. The company has not been profitable since its inception, but this was predicted by their founders. They understood that they would have to lose money to gain a following, and they have done both; since 2015 Lemonade has grown its customer base to close to half a million by 2018 and its debt to $234.8 million as of the end of 2019.

<!-- What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics -->
* There are a few metrics to look at to guage Lemonade's success in the market so far. Obviously, being cash flow negative is something that needs to be addressed in order to make a thriving business continue. There are other metrics to look at however. One way to look at their projection is how many people they employ. At the end of 2018 they had 117 people on staff, now it is over 329 employees. They are also looking to continue to gorow as they have multiple positions open on their site. They are covering just shy of $50 billion in total value as of 2018, and they have only grown since. 

<!-- How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? -->
* In comparison to other companies in this space these numbers are on the low side as some companies have thousands of employees and billions in assets covered. ZhongAn, for example, has 2842 employees with revenue at 812 million. Lemonade is still an up and coming company that also gives away good portions of their money in the giveback program. 


<!-- Recommendations -->
## Recommendations


<!-- If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? -->
* If I were to advise this company, I would have them focus on expanding to all fifty states with their current insurance policies before breaking into new fields. I also think that the debt the company is currently under should be addressed. 

<!-- Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? -->
* Expanding into all fifty states with coverage of insurance for Lemonade will be key. Consumers will deem them a more legitimate contender when that expansion happens; it will give credibility and establishment in the market.

<!-- What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? -->
* The most important technologies to focus on for Lemonade would be their mobile app and their ability to process claims. 

<!-- Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? -->
* The ability to use your smart phone for the app will be an attraction for all consumers. It is an easy transition from app that they are comfortable using every day. This paired with upfront service will reap rewards.
